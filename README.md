Scala uses implicit variables in order to thread functionality through a code base the same way that
Haskell uses typeclasses. This is a very poor implementation of that strategy in Haskell, using
GHC's `ImplicitParams` feature. There is a major difference however, in how the complier finds
values for the implicit arguments. In Haskell, a function with implicit parameters must be used
within the context of a `let` or `where` that explicitly binds the implicit variables, i.e.
```haskell
let ?implicitArg = someValue in functionWithImplicitParam
```
or within a function that provides that implicit argument in the context, i.e.
```haskell
foo :: (?implicitArg :: SomeType) => Foo -> Bar
foo = bar functionWithImplicitParam
```
Additionally, GHC requires that the name of the implicit binding match the name of the
implicit parameter. So the following fails to compile:
```haskell
foo :: (?implicitArg :: SomeType) => Foo -> Bar
foo = bar functionWithImplicitParam

baz :: Foo -> Bar
baz x = foo x
  where
    ?anotherName = (someValue :: SomeType)
```
because `?anotherName` does not match the name `?implicitArg`.

These differences make using this functionality to replace typeclasses entirely impractical,
especially because you cannot have the same name with two different types in the available implicit
bindings at once, i.e.
```haskell
mconcat :: (?monoid :: Monoid a) => [a] -> a
mconcat = \case
  [] -> mempty
  x:xs -> x <> mconcat xs

foo :: Int
foo = length (mconcat nestedList) <> mconcat listOfInts
  where
    ?monoid = intMonoid
    ?monoid = listMonoid
    ?foldable = listFoldable
```
This is valid syntactically, but fails to appropriately dispatch the correct `?monoid` to each
`mconcat` based on its type. It's a cool idea and fun to learn about, but not useful for actual
programming as far as I know.

One potential downside in general to this strategy is a lack of coherence. For instance, a binary
search tree requires an `Ord` instance on its type parameter. One could use one `Ord a` for creating
the tree, and another for updating it, breaking its internal invariant on its structure and losing
all guarantees about subsequent queries and traversals. This can be mitigated by indexing the tree
type over the `Ord a` itself, but that requires dependent types.

However an advantage of this style is the ability to correctly encode the `Semigroup` type. With
actual typeclasses this is impossible because of coherence, since you need to have two distinct
`Monoid a`s in order to create a `Semigroup a`. Even with named interface implementations Ã  la
Idris, this remains impossible because it only allows one implementation in a context at a time
because you cannot name them within the context itself.
